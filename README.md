# ECG-analysis
Data and analysis scripts for analysis of visual transitions on ECGs. The data is stored in the **data** directory. The main file is the **ECG_study_1.R** file and is the one that should be run. The script was designed to run on the Windows OS. The other files contain supporting functions **(ECG_data_prep.R)** and metadata about the stimuli **(experiment_1.R)**.
